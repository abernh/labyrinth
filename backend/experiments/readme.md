All scripts require the path to the shared library libexhsearch. See instructions in main readme for compilation.
Running the scripts requires the dependencies of `exp-requirements` to be installed in the virtual env.
Due to the dependencies to the labyrinth module, it is also required to add the respective path to the PYTHONPATH, e.g.

    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:path/to/labyrinth/backend/
