""" This module implements functionality for a computer to play the game.

ComputerPlayer is a subclass of model.game.Player, which handles board state and time-keeping.
The computation of player actions is performed by external shared libraries (LibraryBinding).
Clients should use the factory method create_computer_player() to create a ComputerPlayer instance.
